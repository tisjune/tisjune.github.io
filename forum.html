					'text': "It’s called the Reinheitsgebot, which means \“purity law\”, and was issued by the Duke of Bavaria in 1516, making it the oldest currently-valid consumer protection law in the world. It was issued for three reasons: to protect drinkers from high prices, to force people to use wheat to make bread and not beer (haha), and to keep brewers from adding random possibly toxic or hallucinogenic stuff.<br><br>In today’s version of the law, you can only use malted grains, hops, water and yeast. Beers brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot have special status under European Union laws as a protected traditional food.<br><br>Honestly, I was surprised to hear about the law because it seems so restrictive. And so old! But lots of people love German beers, so something must be working, guess the Germans really know what they're doing. What do you guys think?",

							{'author': 'surleesy',
							'text': "The Reinheitsgebot led to German brewers mastering their strains of yeast and knowing which strain to ferment at which temperature to yield specific flavors and characteristics. If this occurred today in some other country, we’d find out pretty quick who had the best ingredients and most creative soup making techniques to get extra flavor out of those few items. "},
							{'author': 'newroamantic',
							'text': "I’m traveling in Germany now and have so far had 3 German IPAs that I would  give a solid 9/10 if not more. All 3 were brewed according to  Reinheitsgebot. If I randomly tried 3 IPAs back in the states I don’t think I would have had as good of luck. To me, something basic but done extremely well is more interesting than something diverse or varied that’s done just ok."},
							{'author': 'gewurtzy',
							'text': "Honestly, as a German, I love our beer! Who knows where we would’ve been without the Bavarian Reinheitsgebot. By the way, the Bavarians make the best beer, and I say this as a Prussian. Let us have our Reinheitsgebot, we Germans have no problems with it, so don’t tell us we should have a problem! I personally am going to celebrate it. Prost, everyone!"},
							{'author': 'yeswecant',
							'text': "Bless the Germans for holding on to something great. The hivemind of the American beer enthusiasts is to tear down tradition and strive for something innovative, and then tell is what we should and shouldn’t like. I mean, we’ve now got all this weird fruity experimentation crap that appeals to the lowest common denominator, come on, would you really call that beer?"},
							{'author': 'full_of_hop',
							'text': "As a beer enthusiast and brewer, I don’t mind the law at all! You actually get a lot of diversity from the type of ingredients, the relative amounts, and how they’re treated before brewing. Different hops can taste vastly different, from fruity-flowery-citrus to extremely bitter. Malt that is toasted beforehand will give you a dark beer that tastes sweeter and more \“toasty\”."},
						],
					'against': [
							{'author': 'slothsuit',
							'text': "The Reinheitsgebot is nothing to be celebrated. It was the brewing equivalent of banning Uber to prop up the taxi industry. It was not a food law, it was a mercantilism law. The original law had a lot more to do with money than consumer health or beer quality. It should be reconsidered: the incentives are completely wrong, and it will damage the German beer industry."},
							{'author': 'skilegs',
							'text': "I live in Salt Lake City, and we have a local brewery by the name of Bohemian Brewery. They brew about 5-6 styles in the Reinheitsgebot tradition. While the beers are decent, they are really quite boring compared to the other options today. They have no personality, if that makes any sense. When I want to drink a super-special beer I tend to go for non-German brews."},
							{'author': 'novemberisch',
							'text': "German here, Munich born and raised. Traditional German beer styles are good for what they are, but I also think that the purity law is hampering innovation and diversity. Sometimes when I go out, I feel like it would be far better to have the option to drink a rice beer, or whatever.  Lots of people I know actually choose foreign beer over German beer if you ask them about favorites."},
							{'author': 'radiofeet',
							'text': "It’s just a marketing thing now. For the most part, the Germans still think beer is only beer if it is Reinheitsgebot. The truth is, the average German knows about as much about the brewing process or brewing history as anyone else, which is basically nothing. If they knew a little more, then maybe they’d open up to something new, and be willing to improve."},
							{'author': 'brooklynborn',
							'text': "America is seeing a huge surge of craft beer and the freedom to put whatever you want into it has produced some of the best beers in the world. If you look at the German beer scene, they often talk about calcification of styles and a resistance to change. That’s resulted in decreased per-capita beer consumption, for one. The Reinheitsgebot makes addressing these trends difficult."},
